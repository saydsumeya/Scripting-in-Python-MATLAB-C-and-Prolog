## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of multiple programming languages to perform image processing tasks, including flipping, rotating, and applying a threshold to images. The program utilizes Python, MATLAB, C, Haskell, and Prolog to showcase proficiency in diverse programming environments and their application in visual enhancements.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into several components, each utilizing a different programming language to accomplish a specific image-processing task:

Python (wrapper.py): Acts as the wrapper for the entire process, coordinating the flow between different languages and ensuring that the input image is processed step by step.

MATLAB (matlab1.m, matlab2.m): Responsible for performing complex image transformations and visual enhancements such as rotation and thresholding.

C (ccprog.c, ccprog2.c): Handles low-level image manipulations, including flipping the image, leveraging the efficiency of C for processing pixel data.

Haskell (haskell2.hs): Applies functional programming techniques to process and transform the image in a unique manner.

Prolog (prolog.pl): Manages logical operations and decision-making processes involved in the image processing pipeline.
